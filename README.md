# Brighter Uoft Project

Brighter UofT was an opposition slate running for the University of Toronto Students' Union. It was the first student organized opposition slate to defeat the Canadian Federation of Students incumbent party, winning an overwhelming 25/30 seats. This website served as the home for the campaign. Combining art and innovative online marketing techniques, the website was a large contributing factor to the success of the slate.
