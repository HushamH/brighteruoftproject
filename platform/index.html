We wish to increase the amount of help and support available for international students before their transition into the U of T community, while increasing services for current international students. This means better advertising which is specifically tailored to international students. We wish to create an awareness campaign on the academic rights of the student that will reach international students. Furthermore, we want international students to have access to better health care and community support. We will advocate for UHIP reform and lobby to have OHIP for international students. We will also push for more emergency funding for special circumstances so that in times of financial crisis, international students are guaranteed that they can still finish their degree.</p>

                                 <p class=lead>We want all first years to experience a community in their classrooms! Con Hall courses are a staple of the first year experience, but they really shouldn’t be. Ensuring that all first year students have the option to take a small course will aid in transition, help first years in a new environment build the social connections that are so crucial to student happiness, and improve the overall learning experience. It’s also an achievable goal: the administration has a vested interest in countering U of T’s “too big” reputation, and research on the benefits of these courses already exists! We will lobby to implement a first year small course guarantee for incoming U of T students.</p>

                                 <p class=lead>We recognise that UTM has its own academic needs. UTM currently lags behind UTSG in number of professors per student. We would like to lobby central admin for a plan that would improve the student:faculty ratio at UTM from 40:1 to 30:1 over 5 years. Furthermore, we will advocate for UTM student representative positions on Governing Council, as well as student representatives on agenda planning for UTM Campus Council. We will work toward financial aid equity: UTM currently has less financial aid available per OSAP student than UTSG. We want to start holding health plan information sessions on the Mississauga campus. We would like to collaborate with the UTMSU to ensure that student needs are being addressed at UTM and that UTM student voices remain appropriately active in the UTSU. We will follow the lead of UTM students in the changes they want to see on their campus.</p>

                                 <p class=lead> The UTSU budget shouldn't be a mystery. We want to improve the UTSU budget by including written reports which explain major expenses and changes, make projections for the future, and including monthly reports to the board about what money has been spent to-date. We also want to make it easier for students to learn what the UTSU is doing and ask questions or raise concerns without the intimidation of attending a formal board of directors meeting. We will introduce monthly "accountability cafes" so that students can learn about what the UTSU is doing and ask questions in a safe, welcoming space.</p>

We want you to be able to sort through it and find things that match your passions, hobbies, and free-food preferences. We want to increase accessibility to clubs & events on campuses by creating a universal campus bulletin that contains all events (club meetings, seminars, etc) on both St. George and Mississauga campuses on any given day. We have big dreams for this service: we want you to be able to sort through events by type or theme or tag, or add personalised preferences. We believe that not only would the bulletin make it easier to be involved, but it would aid clubs in advertising and co-ordinating their events. U of T is more than classes, and we want to help people realise that.</p>

                                 <p class=lead>Life as a commuter is challenging. Rush hour sucks. So does never being able to attend events that are too late! We want to make getting involved as a commuter easier, with commute-conscious scheduling. We will host social events during rush hour so you can avoid the jam, while jamming out with new friends, and we will also push events forward so that commuters aren’t stuck going home so late. It's important to us that we host events which occur at the same time and place every week so that you can see the same faces, make friends and feel part of a community. It’s also easier to be involved if life isn’t expensive. We will work with other GTA campuses to lobby to reduce rising transit costs, and work to change the two-card TTC system. Specifically, we want to push for the introduction of GO co-fares with the TTC so that students do not have to pay a full fare just to ride from Union station to St. George station, and ensure that all municipalities in the GTA have post-secondary discounts.</p>

                                 <p class=lead> We want to keep your fees fair and ensure that nobody is ever prevented from continuing their education because of financial matters. This means expanding access to bursaries and need-based scholarships, and lobbying the provincial government to fix OSAP so that students don’t have to live beneath the poverty line. We would strive to regulate Professional Tuition Fees, and lobby for a cross-campus expansion of The New College Residence Bursaries for students who take double rooms and who have financial need. We also want to make sure that our money comes back to us: when we pay for “service ancillaries” (parking, residences, food services, etc.), the money is supposed to contribute back to the operating budget, often in the form of bursaries or services which directly benefit students. However, sometimes service ancillaries can end up paying for admin or overhead costs. We would lobby to end this practise, to ensure student dollars contribute only to student experience. Similarly, we will begin the process of “franchising” our services out to communities that are hard to reach, and we will make better uses of our mobile services.</p>

                                 <p class=lead> Mental health services at U of T are seriously lacking. We will lobby for a restructuring of CAPS to reduce wait times and offer a broader range of support: more social workers, psychologists, psychiatric nurses. The university must consider the personal identities and their actual background as councillors. We will lobby the province to ensure that UHIP and OHIP cover psychiatry, cognitive behavioural therapy, and other mental health-related services. We want to de-stigmatise mental illness, and educate students. Mental health and sexual violence are inherently linked issues. Victims of sexual violence are at a high-risk for psychological problems. We wish to work to reduce incidences of sexual violence through education, and ensure that all that are affected by violence are properly supported through the duration of their healing process. As such, we will work with the province to create additional material that fits with orientation. We will coordinate on education programs, make sure orientation leaders are trained, and create an easily accessible listing of resources. We will ensure that the upcoming U of T Policy on Sexual Violence includes hearing procedures which minimize revictimization and re-traumatisation, a victim’s bill of rights, a centralized office for support and proceedings, counselling for survivors, better tools and policy to fight online harassment, a guarantee for those who report that female police officers will be available to respond to all reports of sexual violence cases, and options for confidential reporting. We will ensure that it does not include forced mediation, the 6 month statute of limitations in the Policy and Procedures on Sexual Harassment, or mandatory police involvement. We will continue to listen to student voices and actively include minority and high-risk groups in the process. </p>

We also want to reduce the barriers to accessing funding by assisting clubs in finding funding from other organizations on campus and by implementing online training for clubs policies. We will still require in-person training, but by moving policy training online, the in-person sessions can be focused more on equity leadership and creating safe spaces in club events.</p>

                                 <p class=lead>We believe that you shouldn't have to come for us for services--we should come to you. For discounted tickets, metropasses, and assistance using the health plan or other services of the UTSU such as academic advocacy, we want to work with college and faculty student governments so that you can access services in your area of campus. Many college and faculty student governments already have offices with the proper procedures and cash handling required to sell the discounted tickets and metropasses that the UTSU offers. Because UTSU has resources, such as full-time staff, and greater buying power, it has a good offering of discount services. However, using these almost always requires going to the UTSU office, which is out of the way for some students in academic programs at Vic and St. Mikes or in Engineering. By working with your college or faculty government we can bring these services closer to you. To ensure quick and convenient help using other services, such as the Health and Dental plan, our directors will help us coordinate with local student governments to have training and reference materials that will allow any student leader on campus to direct you to the help you need.</p>

                                 <h2 class=featurette-heading> Engaging <span class=text-muted> Professional Faculties</span> </h2>
                                 <p class=lead> As many of our professional faculty directors will attest to, profacs have been under-served by the UTSU in the past. We will do more for profacs by having an active and engaged professional faculties committee where our profac board members can highlight local issues they want the UTSU to work on. A good example of this is that students in PEY (professional lose OSAP eligibility because it is not a mandatory co-op program. By creating two program streams (which is the practice at the University of Waterloo), it can be made mandatory, replacing the option to not do PEY with the option to switch to a non-PEY stream. The experience for students is essentially the same, but with these changes, students in PEY would be able to keep receiving OSAP. The executive candidates who are Arts and Science students know that we need to listen to profac students in order to even know that these problems exist, and having an engaged professional faculties committee will help. We will also work on addressing some of the concerns brought up by the Engineering society that led up to the defederation referendum. For example, it's only by unusual circumstances that we are able to have an Engineer on our executive team--for many profac students in programs with fixed programs, it is very difficult to drop to part-time to serve as an executive. We want to give the option for some members of the executive to be full-time students so that it is easier for profac students to run for the UTSU.</p>

                                 <h2 class=featurette-heading> Ensuring A More <span class=text-muted> Equitable</span> UofT </h2>
                                 <p class=lead>Students at U of T have different needs based on their identity, and it is important to formally recognise their voices. It is especially important to represent minority voices on campus, including those belonging to racialized minority, sexual minority, gendered, faith-based, cultured, and non-able-bodied groups. We recognize that systems of power and oppression affect a student’s experience, and we want to work to fight all forms of oppression in multiple ways—by creating safe spaces, by supporting and nurturing student activists, and by building equity-focused service into the UTSU board structure. We want to create safe spaces. In safe spaces, students are free to discuss, examine, and share their experiences without being judged and without having their pains and struggles trivialized or diminished. UTSU can do this by directly creating safe spaces as part of event series such as eXpression Against Oppression and by supporting and working with clubs who already create safe spaces. Furthermore, we can help more clubs become equity leaders by introducing mandatory equity training and opportunities for clubs to discuss intersecting problems that they can tackle together. We can lobby to improve the status and resources for offices and programs within U of T which create safe space and do activist work, such as the Anti-Racism and Cultural Diversity Office, Multi-Faith Center, and Transitional Year Program. We want to continue to educate the broader community through activism. We believe that the most effective education and activism comes from the ground up, so we will primarily focus on supporting and nurturing groups of students who work to change perceptions, stereotypes, systems and institutions to create true equality and safety. As well as creating change in the society around us, we want to ensure that the structure of the UTSU includes the representation of marginalized groups as well as representatives from colleges and faculties. In order to successfully transition to the new Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act as well as ensure that board members serve students better, we will push for a “hybrid” board structure that includes members tasked with representing and communicating to students from colleges and faculties and also includes members who serve students that are marginalized by the intersecting systems of privilege and power in society. We want our board to be more responsible for serving their students and communities, and we want them to do that in a way that grows UTSU’s already-strong leadership in equity issues. </p>
